# MinecraftOOP
Based on the videogame, "Minecraft" this project is a means of learning about object oriented programming and its implementation in real life systems. This is a very simplified version of the behaviour of classes and objects in minecraft and is missing various features for the purpose of simplicity. It features a counting function for all entities and their types as well as virtual functions. I'm yet to learn about applying Daughter-class methods, but some are still built in.
